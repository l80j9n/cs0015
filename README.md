●   Save a pdf of your completed document, and upload the pdf into Canvas by the due time/date.
●   Graders will use turnitin to check for plagiarism.    Cheating and plagiarism will result in an automatic score of zero for this assignment, and all academic integrity violations will be reported to the UCI Office of Academic Integrity  Student Conduct.
●   How to avoid cheating and plagiarism on this assignment:
○   All direct quotes must be cited regardless of the source material.
○   Cite the source at the end of the specific task for which it was used.
○   If the instructions of a task send you to a source (e.g., to a page on ARDA.com) and you do not directly quote or paraphrase the source in your answer for that task, you do not need to cite the source.
○   If your answer relies on sources outside of those included in a task’s instructions, you must cite the outside sources you used at the end of the task.
○   You may use one or more LLMs to complete this assignment, but their usage must be documented in a manner consistent with the syllabus.Prepare 
Here is a simple 2x2 Pascal’s Wager decision matrix:

States 

God exists (p) God does not exist (1-p) 
Actions Live piously W X Act Worldly Y Z 
For this assignment you will decide and justify what should be the numerical values for parameters W, X, Y, Z, and p if this matrix is to accurately represent the decision for the typical American adult.
Carefully review MM 1.2-1.4.
Next go to TheARDA.com, and click on “US RELIGION” then “STATISTICS” and then “BELIEFS (QUICKSTATS).”    On this page you will find links that report how a sample of Americans answered survey questions about moral issues, religion and politics, religious beliefs, and more.    Explore several of the links to see the type of information that is reported.Tasks 
1.   Using your best judgment, select at least five survey questions from this web page to help in deciding what are the best values for your decision matrix to most accurately represent a typical American adult.    In the table below, enter the questions you selected, and for each question explain why you selected it and which parameter(s) the question will address.    [Note: five survey questions are sufficient, but if you want to use more than five then please add rows to the table as needed.]Survey Question Justification (2-4 sentences each)

2.   For each of the survey questions you identified in Task 1, explain what the survey responses reveal about the typical American. What did you learn? Add additional rows if you identified more than five survey questions in Task 1.Survey Question From Task 1 Wh代 写Econ 17 Assignment 1Prolog

3.   Complete the following table to declare and justify the parameter values that you selected to represent a typical American adult. (Remember that p represents a probability, so it will always be between 0 and 1. W, X, Y, and Z are not probabilities, so they do not have to be between 0 and 1.) When providing your justification for any particular parameter:
○   Explain why that parameter value represents a typical American adult.
○   Each justification should refer to something you learned in Tasks 1 and 2.
○   Provide a short paragraph for each justification.Parameter Value Justification (3-5 sentences each) W [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] X [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] Y [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] Z [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] p [insert number here]

4.   Living piously is the optimal choice when  
Using this fact and your parameter values from Task 3 above, calculate the values for p for which living piously is the typical American adult’s optimal choice.
5.   Yes or no:    Based on your value for p in Task 3 and your calculation in Task 4, should the typical American live piously?
6.   Your own views might be different from those of the typical American. Complete the table below to declare and justify what you believe the parameters for the Pascal’s Wager decision matrix should be. For each justification, explain why your parameter value is the same or different from that in Task 3 above.    [Note: you are graded for how well you justify your parameter values and not the parameter values themselves or your honesty in representing yourself.]Parameter Value Justification (3-5 sentences each) W [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] X [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] Y [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] Z [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] p [insert number here] 
[insert justification here] 
7.   Yes or no:    According to your personal parameter values from Task 6, should you be living piously?    Explain your answer.
8.   A Pascal’s Wager decision matrix is obviously a highly simplified representation of how people decide to live their lives.    One of the shortcomings of this simple depiction of Pascal’s Wager is that it is based on a very particular notion of God from a particular Christian theology, but there are other notions of God from within Christianity and from other religious traditions.
Revise the Pascal’s Decision matrix immediately below so that it incorporates other types of beliefs about God.    Insert additional rows or columns if needed, and indicate your changes by applying a blue font color.    Be sure to list payoffs numbers.

States 

God exists God does not exist 
Actions Live piously Act worldly 
9.   In approximately 150-250 words, explain the logic behind your changes to the matrix you made to complete Task 8.
10.   Based on what you learned about the typical American adult, how should the typical American adult act if faced with your decision matrix from Task 8?    When providing your answer:
○   Provide a worded explanation of how you reached your conclusion.
○   You can provide a mathematical calculation if you think it will help support your answer.
○   Your answer should be at least 2-4 sentences.
